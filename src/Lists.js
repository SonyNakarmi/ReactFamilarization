    // keys help react itdentify which items have changed and normally should be unique ID or index

    // A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.
    // Keys serve as a hint to React but they donâ€™t get passed to your components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name:
